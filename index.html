    <div class="About">
    <p class="journey">
        I'm a 17 years old student from Nigeria who is passionate about Full-stack software developmet.I was 
        born on August 4th 2007. I hail from Lagos state, Badagry specifically. Completed my secondary school
        education in 2023.  
        Currently on the brink of entering university, I am eager to delve deeper into the 
        world of technology and develop my skills in this field. I look forward to exploring 
        new horizons and contributing to the ever-evolving tech industry.
        My current goals are to establish a strong and practical foundation in coding and software engineering. 
        I greatly enjoy coding; it serves as a form of therapy for me. I was introduced to coding when I was 
        around 8 years old. However, at that time, I didn't have  sufficient information and access to the 
        necessary resources. Additionally, I found it challenging and did not have the time to dedicate to it, 
        which led me to discontinue.

    <p class="journey">
        Around early October 2023, my uncle informed me about Alt_School Africa. I remembered going to their 
        website to check it out, and then the application form for School of Engineering wasn't out yet. 
        I had to wait for over 2 months. And I did not only wait, I had to save money for my application fee. 
        I remembered going to their website, almost everyday to check if the application form was out, I was 
        both excited and impatient. Eventually, I applied to Alt School in late February this year. I felt happy
         and even happier when I passed the school's entrance exam. I am thrilled to have come this far.
    </p>
    <p class="journey">
        The reason I joined Alt_school Africa was to achieve my current goal which is to establish a strong and practical 
        foundation in coding and software engineering with a hope to get internships. Joining Alt_School Africa made 
        me feel like I made a bold step and a good progress towards my goal. And My goal doesn't end at Alt_school Africa. 
        I still have plans of getting a B.Sc. and eventually a master's in Computer Science.
As I look towards the future, I am filled with a sense of purpose and determination. The journey ahead may seem challenging,
 but I am prepared to face it head-on with determination and a relentless drive for success.
